Welcome to the Docker image for the FastSolve development team!

The FastSolve modules are under ~/fastsolve, precompiled for Octave and MATLAB.
Please save your code and data in ~/shared or ~/fastsolve, or you may lose it
when the Docker container exits. The ~/shared directory maps to the current
work directory on the host computer, so you can exchange data through it.

To use git with ssh authentication, make sure the ssh key on your host computer
is in bitbucket and github, and then run "ssh-add" in this terminal to add your
ssh key to the ssh-agent.

Happy coding!
