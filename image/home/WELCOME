Welcome to the Docker image for the FastSolve development team!

The FastSolve modules are under ~/projects/fastsolve, precompiled for Octave
and MATLAB. Please save your code and data in ~/shared or ~/projects, or you
would lose them when the Docker container exits. The ~/shared directory maps
to the current work directory on your host computer, so you can exchange data
through it.

To use git with ssh authentication, make sure the ssh key on your host computer
is in bitbucket and github, and then run "ssh-add" in this terminal to add your
ssh key to the ssh-agent.

Happy coding!
